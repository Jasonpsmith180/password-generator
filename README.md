## Random Password Generator

Hi! My name is Jason Smith. This is my random password generator application.

## About the project
Everyone needs a strong password these days, so I made this random password generator!
The project is written mostly in JavaScript. Using a few arrays and some Math.random()
it is able to generate a password between 8 and 128 characters long with four different options for password
criteria (lowercase, uppercase, number, and special character sets). The program starts when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button. Then the user is presented with a series of prompts to customize the password to their liking. Once the user answers all of the prompts a new random password is generated in the main text box.  

This project was quite a challenge but it was extremely rewarding to see it work once all the code was written. I learned a few new techniques with this project. Concat was essential to combining my arrays together to generate the password once all the user inputs were entered. the confirm prompt box was also new to me but made the user inputs easy to capture and use. I also used isNaN to validate if the user entered a number for their password length.  

When I was finishing up the project I learned there was an easier way to combine the arrays instead of using the many concat if statements that I wrote out. Using the push and the flat functions I can significantly reduce the amount of code to get the project to work, so I will be revisiting this project in the future to refactor the code a little bit.
